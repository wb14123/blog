# Guide for Phrasing and Sentence Structure Review

* Review the article for awkward phrasing, unnatural sentence flow, and syntax that sounds weird or unsmooth to native speakers.
* Focus on sentence structure, word choice, and natural language flow rather than grammar rules (checked in @grammar-review.md) or technical correctness (checked in @correctness-review.md).
* Make sure phrases and expressions sound natural and idiomatic in English.
* DO NOT change the file.
* Discuss every found issue with the user:
  * Describe the issue with reference to the text.
  * Give suggestions for the fix.
  * Output all the issues at once.
