# Guide for Correctness Check

* The technical correctness includes but not limited to these things:
  * Code example and syntax.
  * Algorithm descriptions.
  * Technical concepts and definitions.
  * System architecture designs and claims.
  * Mathematical formulas.
* Check facts in the articles. Search the internet if possible. Use reliable source like reputable news organizations, official website of the software mentioned and so on.
* Check the terminologies used in the articles are correct and used in a correct way.
* Check if there is confusing, not so clear description in the article.
* Break down into multiple sections if needed, and discuss them one by one with the user.
* All the links in the article without host name are paths under the domain `https://binwang.me`. You can fetch remote web pages if needed.
* Ignore grammar errors and the checks mentioned in @grammar-review.md .
* If there are correctness problems, respond with the problems in the chat instead of modify the article files themselves.
