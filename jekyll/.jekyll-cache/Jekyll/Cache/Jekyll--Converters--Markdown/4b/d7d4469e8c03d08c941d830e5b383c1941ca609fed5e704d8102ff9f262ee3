I"%<p>These days I’m working on a new chrome extension: <a href="http://www.crazyhotice.com/comment_everywhere">comment everywhere</a>. It is an extension to allow you to comment on any web pages. It will have these features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Of cause, comment on any web pages.</li>
  <li>Show the web pages you have comment.</li>
  <li>Show some web pages that have most comments.</li>
  <li>Get comments from SNS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three features have been implied. I’m working on fetching comments from <a href="http://weibo.com">Weibo.com</a> now.</p>

<p>I have learned a lot while I write this extension. Both technology part and the non-technology part. The technology part is I’m using these techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Node.js as backend.</li>
  <li>MongoDB as database.</li>
  <li>Javascript for extension develop.</li>
  <li>CSS and HTML for UI and homepage design.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to say json is awesome.</p>

<p>The non-technology part is I really learned you always spend more time to write a product than you thought. I spend almost a month to write such a extension (though I have less time to code this month). It makes me more modest.</p>

<p>Though the basic features have been complete, it takes more to make it looks like a real product. But I believe I’m on the road.</p>
