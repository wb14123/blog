I"³<p>I removed categories from my blog today. I did this for some reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need pagination. But there is no neat way to paginate in categories index.</li>
  <li>I can focus on writing but not thinking which category I should put my new post.</li>
  <li>Tag is enough. Though index by tags is not available now, I will figure out a way.</li>
  <li>It keeps this site more simple!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cause I did not index my posts by categories, the urls have changed a little. Maybe it will affect Googleâ€™s index and my blogâ€™s search. But since my blog is relatively new, I will accept it. (It is not a big deal since Iâ€™m thinking about change my siteâ€™s domain).</p>

<p>Here is some thoughts about tags. I have seen lots of tag plugins for jekyll, but most of them could only index by one tag. I prefer to see how many posts are under several tags. I may use Javascript to do it some day.</p>

<p>By the way, Iâ€™m not good at html and css. Other open sourced jekyll site helped me a lot. Especially the <a href="https://github.com/shenfeng/shenfeng.me">source code of my old colleagueâ€™s blog</a>. When I have some questions, just look at the source code and it will be clear.</p>
