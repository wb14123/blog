I"?<p>I’ve bought a Surface Pro 4 some days ago. It is very amazing and I’d like to use it as my backup development laptop. My daily development is under Linux and Mac OS X. I use terminal and lots of bash scripts everyday. So I need a Unix-like environment on Windows. This article will introduce how to do that.</p>
