I"Õ<p>When I open my blog, I suddenly realized that I havenâ€™t even writen one blog in 2017. Iâ€™ve tried to write some blogs about technology but it spent too much time and energy so I gave up at last. There happens a lot of things on me in 2017. So I must write something while the next year is beginning. Things have changed both on my life and my work. I donâ€™t want to write too many details on my personal life, so I will just record some work related things.</p>
