I"<p>These days I’m confused with the virt-manager’s network. While I use the Fedora guest to connect to 192.168.122.1, it always connect to itself. I searched on the internet but there are little information. I mean, though the information, it should work.</p>

<p>I finally solved it today. It turns out the fedora guest also start <code>libvirtd</code>. Which will create another virt network and use itself as the host. If you run <code>ifconfig</code> on the guest, you will see it has a device <code>vnet0</code> with IP 192.168.122.1.</p>

<p>So just disable <code>libvirtd</code> on the guest, then restart <code>libvirtd</code> and virt-manager on the host. After all, you could connect to the host through 192.168.122.1 with the default configuration.</p>
