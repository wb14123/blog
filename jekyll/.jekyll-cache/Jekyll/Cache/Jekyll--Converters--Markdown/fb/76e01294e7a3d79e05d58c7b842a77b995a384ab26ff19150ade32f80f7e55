I"•<p>For the last few days, I was working on integrating <a href="https://sentry.apache.org">Apache Sentry</a> into our database product Splice Machine. And when doing that, I found the document of Sentry is awful. It takes me much time to figure out whatâ€™s the role of Sentry and how to configure it. So in this article, Iâ€™d like to write some really important things to help understanding Sentry.</p>
