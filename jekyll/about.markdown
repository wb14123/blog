Hi, I’m Bin Wang (王斌). Welcome to my personal website. I record my thought, research and life here. You can find them in the [index page](/).

I also list [where I have been](/travel.html) and [what I have read](/read.html). Since there is an old saying in Chinese: "Walk thousands of miles, and read thousands of books (行千里路，读万卷书)". I belive it makes my life vaster and more beautiful.

If you want to search something in this website. You can click [search](/search.html) above. It is powered by Google, so it may not has a good timeliness.

At last, here are some of my informations.
