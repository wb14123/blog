Hi, I’m Bin Wang (王斌). Welcome to my personal website.

Here, I share my thoughts, research, and life experiences. You can find the site index on the left side of the page if you're on a larger screen, or by tapping the menu button at the top left on smaller devices. If you'd like to stay updated, feel free to subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed.xml) for new posts.

In addition to long-form posts, I also write poetry (see the [Poetry](/poetry) page). For shorter reflections and ideas, check out the [Snippets](/snippets) page.

As a programmer, I enjoy building side projects and contributing to open-source software. You can find some of my work on [my Github profile](https://github.com/wb14123).

I also keep track of the [places I've visited](/travel.html) and [the books I've read](/read.html). As the old Chinese saying goes: "Walk thousands of miles, and read thousands of books (行千里路，读万卷书)". I believe this broadens my horizons and enriches my life.

If you're looking for something specific, you can use the [Search](/search.html) page. Please note that it's powered by Google, so newly published pages might take some time to appear in the search results.

Lastly, if you'd like to get in touch, feel free to Email me at [bin.wang@mail.binwang.me](mailto:bin.wang@mail.binwang.me).
