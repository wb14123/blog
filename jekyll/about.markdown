Hi, I’m Bin Wang (王斌). Welcome to my personal website. I record my thoughts, research and life here. You can find them in the [index page](/). You can also [subscribe RSS](/feed.xml) for the new posts.

Other than the long posts, I also record some random thoughts with much shorter post. It's powered by [my self hosted Mastodon](https://mastodon.binwang.me/) and you can see them at the [Snippets tab](/snippets).

As a programmer, I also write side projects and contribute to open source projects. You can find some information at [my Github page](https://github.com/wb14123).

I also list [where I have been](/travel.html) and [what I have read](/read.html). Since there is an old saying in Chinese: "Walk thousands of miles, and read thousands of books (行千里路，读万卷书)". I believe it makes my life vaster and more beautiful.

If you want to search something in this website. You can click [search](/search.html) above. It is powered by Google, which means the pages need time to be indexed. So you may not always be able to search the newest post.

At last, if you want to contact me, my Email address is [bin.wang@mail.binwang.me](mailto:bin.wang@mail.binwang.me).
