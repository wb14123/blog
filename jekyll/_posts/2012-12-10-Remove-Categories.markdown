I removed categories from my blog today. I did this for some reasons:

* I need pagination. But there is no neat way to paginate in categories index.
* I can focus on writing but not thinking which category I should put my new post.
* Tag is enough. Though index by tags is not available now, I will figure out a way.
* It keeps this site more simple!

Because I did not index my posts by categories, the URLs have changed a little. Maybe it will affect Google's index and my blog's search. But since my blog is relatively new, I will accept it. (It is not a big deal since I'm thinking about changing my site's domain).

Here are some thoughts about tags. I have seen lots of tag plugins for Jekyll, but most of them could only index by one tag. I prefer to see how many posts are under several tags. I may use JavaScript to do it someday.

By the way, I'm not good at HTML and CSS. Other open-sourced Jekyll sites helped me a lot. Especially the [source code of my old colleague's blog](https://github.com/shenfeng/shenfeng.me). When I have some questions, just look at the source code and it will be clear.
