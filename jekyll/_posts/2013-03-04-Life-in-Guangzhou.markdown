I realize there has been a while since my last blog. I'm a little busy recently. I moved out from Beijing and I'm in Guangzhou now. A lot has happened in Beijing. I always want to write a blog about it, but I need some time to sum them up. Long story short: I had an internship in both a start up (AVOS) and a big company (Redhat), and really learned a lot. I also have learned about how to live a life independently: renting an apartment, socialize , dealing with all kinds of people and so on.

Now I'm in Guangzhou. Mainly because of my girlfriend and the desire of learning more. And I'd like to find if the environment (both IT industry environment and living environment) is better here. The days in Guangzhou is good. But the weather is a little bit unstable. I just rented a good apartment and bought furnitures. So there is only one thing left: finding a job. I hope to find a job related to Linux kernel (or device driver) and embed device. But if the job is really good, website backends is OK, too.

'm doing two things about programming in these days: Submitting patches to Linux kernel while I read the source code and find something should be fixed. And writing a web app with Node.js, which also comes with a chrome extension. Both of those things are really fun.
