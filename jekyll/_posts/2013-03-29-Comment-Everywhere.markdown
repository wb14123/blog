These days I'm working on a new chrome extension: [comment everywhere](http://www.crazyhotice.com/comment_everywhere). It is an extension to allow you to comment on any web pages. It will have these features:

* Of course, comment on any web pages.
* Show the web pages you have commented on.
* Show some web pages that have most comments.
* Get comments from SNS.

The first three features have been implemented. I'm working on fetching comments from [Weibo.com](http://weibo.com) now.

I have learned a lot while I write this extension. Both technology part and the non-technology part. The technology part is I'm using these techniques:

* Node.js as backend.
* MongoDB as database.
* Javascript for extension develop.
* CSS and HTML for UI and homepage design.

I'd like to say json is awesome.

The non-technology part is I really learned you always spend more time to write a product than you thought. I spent almost a month to write such an extension (though I have less time to code this month). It makes me more modest.

Though the basic features have been complete, it takes more to make it look like a real product. But I believe I'm on the road.
