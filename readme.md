## Install Ruby dependencies

Jekyll needs some ruby dependencies. The best way to install them is through [Bundler](https://bundler.io/). After install Bundler, run the following command to install all dependencies:

```
cd ./jekyll
bundle install
```

## Start local server

Start a local server to preview changes:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
``
