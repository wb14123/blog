<p>These days I re-configure my vim and zsh. Then backup them in <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. You can see it at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/dotfiles">here</a>.</p>

<p>Using github to backup dotfiles is really a comfortable way. In this way, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feel free to change your configures, since if you donâ€™t like the configure some day, you can roll it back.</li>
  <li>Update your configures anywhere. Just use git to clone your configure files from github.</li>
  <li>Keep different versions for different machines (Such as for desktop and laptop). Just use branch to control them.</li>
  <li>If you are using vim plugins from git repo or something like <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>, you could simple use git submodule to keep track of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic idea is put configure files in a directory such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">dotfile</code> and use git to track it. Then make a symbolic link to home. However, manual make symbolic links is boring. Firstly I am thinking of use the same directory structure as <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/</code> and then automatic link them. But there comes some problems: for some directories such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.vim</code>, we should make a link for them while for some directories such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.config</code>, we may only want to link <code class="highlighter-rouge">openbox</code> under it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.config/openbox</code>. It seems impossible to use an automatic way totally. But some shell code could make life a little easy:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>check_link() {
	LINK=`pwd`/$1
	TARGET=~/$2
	if [ -h $TARGET ] ; then
		echo -n "remove symbolic link: "
		rm -v $TARGET
	elif [ -e $TARGET ] ; then
		echo -n "move: "
		mv -v $TARGET $TARGET.old
	fi
	echo -n "link: "
	ln -sv $LINK $TARGET
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Usage: <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_link &lt;path_in_dotfiles&gt; &lt;path_in_home&gt;</code>, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">check_link vim/vimrc .vimrc</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/dotfiles/blob/master/link.sh">my github repo</a> for details.</p>
