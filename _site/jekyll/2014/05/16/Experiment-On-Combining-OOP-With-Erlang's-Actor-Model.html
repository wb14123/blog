<p>Erlang’s actor model is good to use, but its syntax is not. Elixir is a very great language, but I don’t think it is enough. So I hacked it a little and did some experiments on turning it into an OOP language in some way.</p>

<h2 id="oop-suits-actor-model-better">OOP Suits Actor Model Better</h2>

<p>Erlang is a pure functional language. There are some arguments between OOP and FP. The point of pure functional programming is it avoids side effects: the function always gives the same result while the inputs are same. In Erlang or Elixir, it is true with the functions. But when there comes an actor (a <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code> for example), it is not so true. Let’s look at a <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code> module for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>-module(example).

init(_Opts) -&gt; {ok, []}.

handle_call(Msg, _from, State) -&gt; {reply, State, [Msg | State]}.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It is FP for now. The state of the actor is one of the input, so it always give the same result while the inputs are same.</p>

<p>But when you call the methods from the outside, it is not so true. For example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="err">ok,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Pid</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">gen_server:start_link(example,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="err">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="err">),</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="err">%%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">A</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">B</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">will</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">not</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">be</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">same</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">here</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">A</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">gen_server:call(Pid,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="err">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">B</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">gen_server:call(Pid,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="err">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>See? In this example, the two calls of <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server:call</code> with the same inputs will not give the same outputs. It is because the actors <strong>do have state</strong>. So I think it is more suitable to think it in an OOP way.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-complex-to-define-a-good-actor-in-erlang">It Is Complex To Define A Good Actor In Erlang</h2>

<p>After I write Erlang programs about half a year, I realized that it puts too many works to the programmer which could be done by the compiler or library. For example, in order to define a module with <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code>, we need to do these things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define a module which behaviour is <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code>, and define the callbacks, and an API <code class="highlighter-rouge">start_link</code> which will be invoked by the supervisor.</li>
  <li>Define a module which behaviour is <code class="highlighter-rouge">supervisor</code> to supervise these actors.</li>
  <li>Define a module with the API, which will invoke <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server:call</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server:cast</code> to sent messages to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code> that is just defined.</li>
</ol>

<p>Elixir reduce the complex of Erlang’s syntax a lot. But it doesn’t reduce the steps above. I will write a library that do these things for the programmer, in an OOP way.</p>

<h2 id="my-implementation">My Implementation</h2>

<p>Things should be done just like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#this defines a `gen_server`
defmodule Basic do
  use Eroop

  init _(init_count) do
    # "@" means the state in actor
    @counter = init_count
  end

  async add(num) do
    @counter = @counter + num
  end

  sync get do
    @counter
  end
end

# this starts a `gen_server`
c = Basic.new 2
# this will be executed asynced
c.add 1
# this will be exeuted synced and get its result
count = c.get

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I think I don’t need to explain much about it if you are familiar with Erlang, actor model or Elixir. Thanks for the powerful Elixir and its macro, I’ve implemented it in a clean way. (View the source code <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/eroop">on Github</a>).</p>

<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>

<p>But there are also some problems here. The first one is: I would except the supervisor to work.</p>

<p>For example, I’d like this code to work:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>defmodule Crash do
  use Eroop

  init _(init_count), do: @counter = init_count
  async crash, do: 0/0
  sync get, do: @counter
end

Crash.start_sup
c = Crash.new 1
# Thought it is crashed, the supervisor should restart it and assign its new pid to `c`
c.crash
count = c.get
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The fact is, the supervisor is able to restart it, but the variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> lost the pid of the new started server,  so <code class="highlighter-rouge">c.get</code> will not success. There are some ways to fix it, do a little hack and register <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_server</code>’s name is one of them.</p>

<p>But the code will be complex, and it pushes me to think:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Erlang is not an OOP platform.</li>
  <li>I still think OOP suits actor model better than FP.</li>
</ol>

<p>You must want to remind me about Scala. But its actor syntax is as worse as Erlang’s. And it is not as easy to extend its syntax as Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="next-plan">Next Plan</h2>

<p>So, what’s my choice? My choice is stop thinking about actor model for a moment and start to learn some Haskell. I’ve heard Haskell solves concurrency problems well and is more clean to build big applications with pure function. I want to have a look at it. So learn Haskell is my next plan. You can wait to see my posts about it!</p>
