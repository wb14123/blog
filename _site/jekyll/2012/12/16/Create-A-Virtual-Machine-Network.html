<p>Because of some problems I’m working on, I need some test machines with Windows and some Linux distribution installed. It is impossible to have so many machines or install so many systems on my laptop. So I use <a href="http://www.qemu.org">qemu</a> to create some virtual machines and use <a href="http://virt-manager.org/">virt-manager</a> to manage them. Here is what I have now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My host: Archlinux, 64 bits, Core i3, 2G RAM, 2G swap.</li>
  <li>Guest 1: Ubuntu 8.10 desktop, 64 bits, 1 core, 512M RAM.</li>
  <li>Guest 2: Ubuntu 12.10 server, 64 bits, 1 core, 512M RAM.</li>
  <li>Guest 3: Windows XP, x86, 1 core, 512M RAM.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two points I’d like to say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Qemu with <a href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/">kvm</a> is quite effective. I could start three guests (or more) at the same time and it works very well.</li>
  <li>Virt-manager is very easy to use. Before it , I waste almost a whole day to use qemu’s command line to put the three guests into a same VLAN.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m quite happy with these now. I could</p>

<ul>
  <li>Try whatever Linux distribution I’d like.</li>
  <li>Do experiments in multi-host environment.</li>
  <li>Test whatever on any OS and need nothing to worry about.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all, I want to say something about virtaulization. I think the only useful situation of virtaulization is testing, learning or trying to do something for fun. I’m not saying it is not important. When a technology could let us do some funny things, it will be really awesome and important.</p>
