# Guide for Grammar Review

* Review the article for problems like grammar errors, spelling errors, typos, capitalization, and so on.
* The theme of the articles can cover a wide range of topics. So do not assume the formality and change it.
* Make sure the terminologies are consistent across the article. If not sure which one to use, ask the user.
* If you are uncertain about some fix, always ask the user for clarification.
* Write the fix to a new file under the same folder named `<original_filename>.new`. If such a file already exists, ask the user if they want to delete it first. The new file should be the fixed article without anything else. If you need to respond with any summary or suggestions, respond in the chat instead of in the new file.
* Keep the metadata header in the new file. (The part between the two `---`).
* Keep the markdown formatting.
* You can give suggestions in the chat, but don't change the following things:
  * The structure of the article.
  * The tone of the article.
  * Awkward phrasing.
  * Minor stylistic improvements.
