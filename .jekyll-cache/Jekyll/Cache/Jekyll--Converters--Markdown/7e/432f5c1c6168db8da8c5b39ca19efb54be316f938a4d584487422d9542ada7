I";<p>Hi, I’m Bin Wang (王斌). Welcome to my personal website. I record my thoughts, research and life here. You can find them in the <a href="/">index page</a>. You can also <a href="/feed.xml">subscribe RSS</a> for the new posts.</p>

<p>Other than the long posts, I also record some random thoughts with much shorter post. It’s powered by <a href="https://mastodon.binwang.me/">my self hosted Mastodon</a> and you can see them at the <a href="/snippets">Snippets tab</a>.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I also write side projects and contribute to open source projects. You can find some information at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123">my Github page</a>.</p>

<p>I also list <a href="/travel.html">where I have been</a> and <a href="/read.html">what I have read</a>. Since there is an old saying in Chinese: “Walk thousands of miles, and read thousands of books (行千里路，读万卷书)”. I believe it makes my life vaster and more beautiful.</p>

<p>If you want to search something in this website. You can click <a href="/search.html">search</a> above. It is powered by Google, which means the pages need time to be indexed. So you may not always be able to search the newest post.</p>

<p>At last, if you want to contact me, my Email address is <a href="mailto:bin.wang@mail.binwang.me">bin.wang@mail.binwang.me</a>.</p>
