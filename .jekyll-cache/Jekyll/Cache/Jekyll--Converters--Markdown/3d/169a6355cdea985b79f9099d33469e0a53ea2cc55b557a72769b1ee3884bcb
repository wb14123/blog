I"R<p>These days, I bought some hardware and build a computer by myself. It’s fun and I’ve learned lots of things from it. Here is a note to record it.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-built-it">Why I Built It</h2>

<p>This computer is used for working and learning. I build it for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Linux. I’ve used Linux for many years and then used MacOS X. I missed the days of using Linux, which I can control everything.</li>
  <li>Run deep learning programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<table> <tr><td>CPU</td> <td>Intel i5-6600k</td> <td>It is easy to overclock and has built in graphics to support 4k at 60Hz.</td></tr>


<tr><td>RAM</td> <td>G.Skill DDR4 2400Hz * 2</td> <td></td></tr>

<tr><td>SSD</td> <td>Samsung 850 EVO 120G SATA3</td> <td>I use this for the system volume.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Disk</td> <td>WD blue disk 2TB * 2</td> <td>I use this for the data volume. These two disks are built with Raid 1 so the data is safe. I've considered to buy three 1TB disks and built Raid 5, but the price is not so good.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Motherboard</td> <td>GIGABYTE Z160X-UD3</td> <td>This motherboard is extendable. However, it doesn't support display port for 4k at 60Hz. (I found this after I bought it and I couldn't return it ...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Power</td> <td>GreatWall 600W GW-7000D</td> <td>It has enough power.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Case</td> <td>SAMA Tank</td> <td>This case is big enough. However, it has just two 3.5 disk positions and three 2.5 disk positions. But I can deal with it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>CPU Cooler</td> <td>DeepCool</td> <td>This cooler is by wind and the noise is small.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Monitor</td> <td>DELL P2715Q</td> <td>This monitor has 4k support. The display effect is very fantasy.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Graphics</td> <td>NVIDIA GTX 1080</td> <td>I haven't buy it yet. Use this to run deep learning programs.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I may share all my configurations some day. Here is a brief list:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>OS</td> <td>Archlinux</td> <td>I've used ArchLinux for many years and I love the philosophies like rolling update, just install what you need ans so on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Window Manager</td> <td>i3wm</td> <td>Tilling window manger is very awesome.</td> </tr>
<tr><td>dmenu</td> <td>Rofi</td> <td>It supports fuzzy search and searching opening windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monitor</td> <td>Conky</td> <td></td></tr>
