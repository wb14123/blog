I"’<p><a href="https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet">MXNet</a> is a deep learning library. I read its doc and some of its source code. It looks very good. So Iâ€™d like to install and try it. While Iâ€™m following the <a href="https://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/build.html#build-mxnet-library">installing guide</a> to install it on Mac OS X, it failed to compile with the error <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cblas.h</code> not found. The message pointed out I may miss the BLAS library.</p>

<p>After some search, I find Mac OS X seems to come with its default BLAS library. But I cannot find its headers. And as an article said, the default BLAS library may not as fast as some third party ones. So I install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OpenBLAS</code> with homebrew:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew install openblas
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is installed under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/opt/openblas</code>, so we need to change these lines in the MXNetâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.mk</code> (it should be copied from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make/osx.mk</code> as the installing guide specified) :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># the additional link flags you want to add
ADD_LDFLAGS = '-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib'

# the additional compile flags you want to add
ADD_CFLAGS = '-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the compile should pass.</p>
