I""<p>There are nothing new in my blog these days. But I am working on something. Mainly learning things and working without new technique challenge (which means you can find information easily in the internet), so I will just list these work here, in case of I forget them some day.</p>

<h2 id="comment-everywhere">Comment Everywhere</h2>

<p>I’m continue writing the chrome extension: Comment Everywhere. I did what I have planed: fetch Weibo (Chinese twitter) message which contains the URL. It is really a fun feature. But I need the feature to be user friendly. The things need to do mainly contains:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weibo message need some time to load. The extension UI should notify user while the message is loading.</li>
  <li>The app should be connected to Weibo, using Sina open API. So the user in Weibo cound be handled better.</li>
  <li>If we just load the URLs which user have clicked, then to “top” section in the extension is useless.</li>
</ol>

<p>And there is one technique thing about mongodb. I’m just using it as a newbie. And I don’t know what will happen when the data and user increased.</p>

<h2 id="linux-kernel">Linux Kernel</h2>

<p>I have read <em>Linux Kernel Development</em> by Robert Love. It introduces kernel APIs a lot. I’m thinking about reading <em>Understanding Linux Kernel</em> for more details. The most attractive thing in kernel is the module design. The other part of kernel handle all the other thing, you just need to focus on what you need to do. Think about scheduler or VFS. You need not to know when the scheduler is being called or when the file operations is happening. What you need to do is to fill the actions while the operations is happening.</p>

<p>And my simple patch about kconfig has been accepted. Though it is only a little change, it encouraged me. I’m planning to read more source and find what is going on about the current kernel development. But it seems too big and I don’t know where to start. If I can have a job about kernel, it will be perfect.</p>

<h2 id="new-languages">New Languages</h2>

<p>I learned Go and write a simple application to fetch Weibo data. And I’m thinking about to learn erlang. It is said to be designed for the “concurrent world”. I have write some node.js code these days, and have some more thoughts about asynchronous and concurrence. They are a little mystery for me in the past. But after read some Linux kernel code and learn some new languages, I feel like I’m lifting the veil.</p>

<h2 id="dd">D&amp;D</h2>

<p>I’m wondering if it could be count as “work”. I really use some time to learn the rules. I’m thinking about to write a web app to play it. But what I need to do is to play it in the real world first.</p>

<h2 id="next-plans">Next Plans</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Continue writing <em>comment everywhere</em>.</li>
  <li>Continue reading and understanding kernel code. Find what I could do to develop kernel.</li>
  <li>Learn more about asynchronous and concurrence. There is <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html">a good book</a>, I will read it.</li>
  <li>Read <em>Concrete Mathematics</em>. I feel I’m a little weak on mathematics now.</li>
  <li>If possible, play D&amp;D!</li>
</ol>

<p>I don’t know if I have time to do all of them. But I will do my best.</p>
