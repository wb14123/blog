I"l<p>I added an <a href="/index_page.html">index page</a> to my blog yesterday, which can also be accessed from the entry “Index” at the top of every page. When I move this Blog to Jekyll, I removed categories since I thought tag should be enough. And categories are not so powerful anyway because it’s just a flat level. These days I want a way to track</p>
