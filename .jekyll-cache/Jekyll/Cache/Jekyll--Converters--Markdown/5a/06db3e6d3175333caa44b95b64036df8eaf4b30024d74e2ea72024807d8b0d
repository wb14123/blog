I"<p>These days, I learned a lot. The more I learned, the more I am tired of programming.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know why modern programming looks so complex, and so ugly. I mean, it should not be.</p>

<p>Because of this, there have been some time Iâ€™m thinking about to give up programming. But if I cannot abstract what I make, what am I able to do?</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m planning to write a series of articles to specify the details, and research on them. Itâ€™s not about the theory. Theories just point out what you can, but not point out how to do it in the real world. The problem now is not I cannot do it, but I cannot do it in a clean way.</p>

<p>The areas include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Database: Why we need to write so many codes to do operations on database?</li>
  <li>Language: Why every language have a disadvantage? And almost in every case, I must use the only language;</li>
  <li>Communication: Is there a good way to communication between threads, processes and machines?</li>
  <li>Font-end: Whatâ€™s a good way to abstracts UI, and the relationship between UI and logic?</li>
  <li>Server: Why I cannot just focus on the logic?</li>
</ul>

<p>These areas are related to each other. All of them are: why it is so complex that we cannot focus on what we want to do? When we write a program, we must put most of our energy on the same, annoying, and not relevant problems.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know how long it will take to research on them, but I must finish them. Because before that, I cannot feel happy while writing code. Good luck to me!</p>
